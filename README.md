### AI Agent Microservices

**anomaly-sage**: Performs risk analysis and anomaly detection on transactions. It writes risk scores and classifications to the `anomaly_logs` table in `ai-meta-db`.

**transaction-sage**: Categorizes transactions, logs details, and tracks budget usage. It writes to the `transaction_logs` and `budget_usage` tables in `ai-meta-db`.

**ai-meta-db**: Central PostgreSQL database for AI agent microservices. Stores logs, budgets, user profiles, and pending confirmations. See [README-ai-meta-db.md](/ai-services/README-ai-meta-db.md) for schema details.

**contact-sage**: Provides contact-related inference and enrichment for accounts and transactions. Examples: suggest likely payees, normalize contact details, or enrich transaction payee metadata. Writes contact-related events to `ai-meta-db`.

**money-sage**: Focuses on budgeting, spend classification and money-management insights (alerts, monthly summaries). Stores budget and classification outputs in `ai-meta-db`.

**orchestrator**: A small coordinator service used by the AI agents. It contains shared auth helpers (`auth.py`), configuration (`config.py`), currency conversion utilities (`currency_converter.py`), and wiring to call other sage services. It can be used to run or locally emulate agent workflows and exposes its own `main.py` entrypoint.

### Running & testing AI services (local / dev)

Each AI microservice under `ai-services/` is a small Python app with a `main.py` and a `requirements.txt`. The `ai-meta-db/` directory contains a PostgreSQL schema (`0001_create_ai_meta_tables.sql`) and a `Dockerfile` to run the database locally.

Quick steps (PowerShell):

```powershell
# 1) Install Python dependencies for the services you want to run (example installs orchestrator deps)
python -m pip install --upgrade pip; python -m pip install -r .\ai-services\orchestrator\requirements.txt

# 2) Run the AI service directly (example: orchestrator)
python .\ai-services\orchestrator\main.py

# 3) Run the database locally (optional) using the Dockerfile in ai-meta-db, or use your preferred Postgres instance.
#    Example: docker build -t ai-meta-db:local .\ai-services\ai-meta-db; docker run -p 5432:5432 ai-meta-db:local

# 4) Run the AI services tests from the repo root (requires pytest)
python -m pip install pytest; pytest .\ai-services\test_ai_services.py -q
```

Notes:
- If you prefer to install all AI service deps at once, install each `requirements.txt` found in `ai-services/*/requirements.txt` or use a virtual environment per service.
- The tests under `ai-services/` are small integration/unit tests for the agent code (see `test_anomaly_sage.py`, `test_contact_sage.py`, `test_money_sage.py`, `test_transaction_sage.py`).


## Interactive quickstart (GKE)

The following button opens up an interactive tutorial showing how to deploy Bank of Anthos in GKE:

[![Open in Cloud Shell](https://gstatic.com/cloudssh/images/open-btn.svg)](https://ssh.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/editor?show=ide&cloudshell_git_repo=https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/bank-of-anthos&cloudshell_workspace=.&cloudshell_tutorial=extras/cloudshell/tutorial.md)

## Quickstart (GKE)

1. Ensure you have the following requirements:
   - [Google Cloud project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#creating_a_project).
   - Shell environment with `gcloud`, `git`, and `kubectl`.

2. Clone the repository.

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/bank-of-anthos
   cd bank-of-anthos/
   ```

3. Set the Google Cloud project and region and ensure the Google Kubernetes Engine API is enabled.

   ```sh
   export PROJECT_ID=<PROJECT_ID>
   export REGION=us-central1
   gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com \
     --project=${PROJECT_ID}
   ```

   Substitute `<PROJECT_ID>` with the ID of your Google Cloud project.

4. Create a GKE cluster and get the credentials for it.

   ```sh
   gcloud container clusters create-auto bank-of-anthos \
     --project=${PROJECT_ID} --region=${REGION}
   ```

   Creating the cluster may take a few minutes.

5. Deploy Bank of Anthos to the cluster.

   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f ./extras/jwt/jwt-secret.yaml
   kubectl apply -f ./kubernetes-manifests
   kubectl apply -f ./kubernetes-manifests/conversational-agent.yaml
   ```

6. Wait for the pods to be ready.

   ```sh
   kubectl get pods
   ```

   After a few minutes, you should see the Pods in a `Running` state:

   ```
   NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   accounts-db-6f589464bc-6r7b7          1/1     Running   0          99s
   balancereader-797bf6d7c5-8xvp6        1/1     Running   0          99s
   contacts-769c4fb556-25pg2             1/1     Running   0          98s
   conversational-agent-1a2b3c4d5e-6f7g8   1/1     Running   0          98s
   frontend-7c96b54f6b-zkdbz             1/1     Running   0          98s
   ledger-db-5b78474d4f-p6xcb            1/1     Running   0          98s
   ledgerwriter-84bf44b95d-65mqf         1/1     Running   0          97s
   loadgenerator-559667b6ff-4zsvb        1/1     Running   0          97s
   transactionhistory-5569754896-z94cn   1/1     Running   0          97s
   userservice-78dc876bff-pdhtl          1/1     Running   0          96s
   ```

7. Access the web frontend in a browser using the frontend's external IP.

   ```sh
   kubectl get service frontend | awk '{print $4}'
   ```

   Visit `http://EXTERNAL_IP` in a web browser to access your instance of Bank of Anthos.

8. Once you are done with it, delete the GKE cluster.

   ```sh
   gcloud container clusters delete bank-of-anthos \
     --project=${PROJECT_ID} --region=${REGION}
   ```

   Deleting the cluster may take a few minutes.

## Additional deployment options


- **Workload Identity**: [See these instructions.](/docs/workload-identity.md)
- **Cloud SQL**: [See these instructions](/extras/cloudsql) to replace the in-cluster databases with hosted Google Cloud SQL.
- **Multi Cluster with Cloud SQL**: [See these instructions](/extras/cloudsql-multicluster) to replicate the app across two regions using GKE, Multi Cluster Ingress, and Google Cloud SQL.
- **Istio**: [See these instructions](/extras/istio) to configure an IngressGateway.
- **Anthos Service Mesh**: ASM requires Workload Identity to be enabled in your GKE cluster. [See the workload identity instructions](/docs/workload-identity.md) to configure and deploy the app. Then, apply `extras/istio/` to your cluster to configure frontend ingress.
- **Java Monolith (VM)**: We provide a version of this app where the three Java microservices are coupled together into one monolithic service, which you can deploy inside a VM (eg. Google Compute Engine). See the [ledgermonolith](/src/ledgermonolith) directory.
